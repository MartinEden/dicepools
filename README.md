# Dice pools
This is a little javascript application written in 2013 (so using quite an old version of jQuery) for calculating dice pool probablities. By dice pool probabilities I mean a tabletop RPG mechanic like so:

1. Roll X dice
1. Count the number of successes (where a "success" is a roll over some number, generally fixed for the game system)
1. You win if the number of successes is greater than some target number

You can adjust how many dice you are rolling, what the target number for each die to count as a success, and how many successes you are interested in rolling.

You can read more about this in my blog post [here](https://weaving-stories.blogspot.com/2013/05/dice-pools-probabilities.html)
